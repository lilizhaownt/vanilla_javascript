<!--step 1: set your goals-->
<h2 id ="step1">Step 1: Set your financial goals</h2>
<p>It is hard to achieve a goal without writing it down.  List your finacial goals from the easiest to the hardest to achieve.  Focus on the easiest goal first and delete them as you accomplish them.</p>

<!--step 2: List all your debt-->
<h2 id ="step2">Step 2: How much debt do you have? </h2>
<p>There are two kinds of debt: good and bad.  Good debt is what you must have in order to build wealth.  For example, a mortage is a good debt because it allows you to buy a house.  A house often increase in value over the years. Another example of good debt is a business loan.  Bad debts are often a result bad spending habits.  An example of bad debt is credit card debt that comes with high interest rates.  Whether it is a good debt or bad debt, debt prevents you from having true financial freedom.  To pay off your debt fast, attack the debt with the highest interest rate first.</p>

<!--step 3: Set your budget-->
<h2 id ="step3">Step 3: Set your budget </h2>
<p>With your financial goals in mind, it is important to budget your income in order to reach those goals.  Your budget should include money to pay for your expenses, debt, and emergency fund. An aggressive budget would be 50% expense /30% debt reduction /20% emergency saving.  We recommend at least 30% of your total income should go toward debt reduction and an emergency saving.</p>
<p>Why do should you include emergency saving as part of your budget?  Life is not perfect.  We all encountered challenges such as loosing a job, injuries, illness, accidents, or car repairs.  An emergency saving prevents you from going into debt during those unfortunate life events.  How much emergency saving is enough?  We recommend that you start with 3 months worth of expenses in mind.  You can increase the amount as your finacial circumstances improve.</p>
<p>When you set your budget, it is important to keep in mind where your money is coming from?  Do you have a regular job that pays weekly, biweekly, or monthly?  Do you get paid by commission where some months you would not have an income?  Set your budget to reflect your income circumstances.  For instances, set a weekly budget if you get paid weekly from a regular job.</p>
